### Structure 

is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document, so in order to learn how to write a webpage, we need to understand how to strcuture document, it is very important

### Extra Markup
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

There have also been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest browsers installed on their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to view all of the latest features and markup.

Where you should be particularly aware of browsers not supporting certain features, I have made a note of this (as you have seen with some of the HTML5 elements introduced in the Forms chapter — and as you will see in the CSS chapters).

### HTML5 Layout

HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML elements you met earlier in the book) because you’ll find it easier to understand how they can be used now that you have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These new elements are going to play an important part in creating layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:

1.The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
2.How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
3.How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web  developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
