# **Introduction**
## 1. Prerequisites 

Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).

## 2. Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Here are the types of it :

* ###  Local Version Control
* ### Centralized Version Control

What is Git? ü§î

#### 1. *Snapshots*

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots , Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it ,
Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

#### 2. *Local Operations*

This allows for process expediency because a project‚Äôs history resides on the local disk, 
eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

#### 3. *Tracking Changes*

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

#### 4. *Loss of Data* üóëÔ∏è

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.


#### 4. *state*

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
