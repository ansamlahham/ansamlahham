# **Mindset growth** ðŸ§ 

## *Mindset growth definition*
Mindset growth is the mirror image if the love of learning,more specifically the way of development through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent .
> Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool
## *Keys to keep myself in growth mindset*
- When Iâ€™m faced with a challenging problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that itâ€™s impossible or that Iâ€™m incapable of solving it
- My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else.
- I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how Iâ€™ve done
