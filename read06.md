# JAVA SCRIPT 
## SCRIPT :
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
1. What is a script and how do I creat one? 
  * A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
  * Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
  * Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
  * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
  
 
  1. **DEFINE THE GOAL**

First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve. 

2. **DESIGN THE SCRIPT**

To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.

3. **CODE EACH STEP **

Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. 

*Note*  : Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically. 

### **EXPRESSIONS**
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly       speaking there are two types of expressions:
  - EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
  - EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.


### **OPERATORS**
- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
  - ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Assign a value to a variable.
  - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: Perform basic math.
  - STRING OPERATORS: Combine two strings.
  - COMPARISON OPERATORS: Compare two values and return true or false.
  - LOGICAL OPERATORS: Combine expressions and return true or false.


  ### **FUNCTIONS**
   - Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
   - Functions can take parameters (informatiorn required to do their job) and may return a value. 
   - An object is a series of variables and functions that
 represent something from the world around you.
   - In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
   - Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
   - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
