# Mastering Markdown #
## What is Markdown? ## 

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, 
adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown

Examples :

### For text ###

### For List ###

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

*Start a line with a star
*Profit!

### Images ###

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:
